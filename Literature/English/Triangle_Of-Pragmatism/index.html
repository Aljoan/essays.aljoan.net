  <p>“Pragmatism,” they say, as if it were a single road. But there are many streets with that name, and some of them end at the sea.</p>
  <p>We live in an age where every actor in the Palestine–Israel story claims pragmatism: the diplomat nursing a ceasefire, the official drafting a recognition speech, the aid worker counting trucks, the fighter cleaning a rifle by candlelight. They cannot all mean the same thing. So what is pragmatism here? A mask for interests, a bridge to justice, or simply the habit of staying alive?</p>
  <p>I propose a simple geometry to read this crowded landscape: a triangle with three vertices—Justice, Stability, and Resistance. No actor stands outside it. Each position is a point within, defined by its distance from the corners. The triangle does not solve the conflict. It reveals its grammar.</p>
  <p>Before we start, a question I ask of any text, policy, or promise—mine included: ¿esto corta como cuchillo, o se diluye como espejismo? Does it cut like a knife, or evaporate like a mirage?</p>

  <section id="vertices">
    <h2>I. The Three Vertices</h2>

    <h3>1) Justice</h3>
    <p>Justice is not a mood. It is a structure: law, rights, dignity, accountability. In this corner sit those who insist that without justice there can be no peace worth having. They speak of occupied peoples and protected civilians, of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the Rome Statute; of the right to life, movement, family, land. Their charge against the age is simple: stability has been bought at the price of legality, and the receipt has no address.</p>

    <h3>2) Stability</h3>
    <p>Stability is the ethic of paramedics and state managers: keep people breathing, keep borders quiet, keep the region from catching fire. In this corner gather the professional realists—some sincere, some cynical—who prefer ceasefires to verdicts, corridors to constitutions, the possible to the righteous. They value what arrives tomorrow morning at the crossing: wheat, fuel, medicine, silence.</p>

    <h3>3) Resistance</h3>
    <p>Resistance is leverage: the insistence that some rights are not given but taken, and that a people erased on paper must be written again in action. Here stand those who believe force is the only language the powerful answer. Their claim: without deterrence there is no negotiation, only instructions; especially when nonviolent marches are met with rifles, and legal appeals with demolitions.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Justice without Stability is recital without rescue.</li>
      <li>Stability without Justice is management of oppression.</li>
      <li>Resistance without Justice is revenge without repair.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The hard work is not choosing a vertex to worship, but walking the interior, holding the coordinates of dignity, order, and agency at once.</p>
    <p><strong>At the heart of the landscape is not an abstraction but a fact:</strong> an occupying army that holds registries, skies, crossings, and lives. All pragmatisms, whether just, stable, or resistant, unfold in the shadow of this asymmetry.</p>

  <section id="currents">
    <h2>II. Fifteen Ways of Calling Yourself “Pragmatic”</h2>
    <p>Within the triangle, the actors arrange themselves into recognizable constellations—fifteen currents that speak the language of pragmatism with different accents. I list them not to fix them forever, but to give names to familiar shadows.</p>

    <p><strong>Arab–Palestinian currents</strong></p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Technocratic Pragmatism:</strong> Aid, logistics, governance. A humanitarian grammar that can keep people alive while refusing to name why they are starving.</li>
      <li><strong>Ethical–Legal Pragmatism:</strong> Rights anchored in law and moral clarity—insisting that peace must be deliverable, not decorative.</li>
      <li><strong>Security Pragmatism:</strong> Regime survival, border management, de-escalation. The short leash of intelligence files.</li>
      <li><strong>Resistance Pragmatism:</strong> The wager that leverage grows from deterrence; that without teeth, rights are pamphlets.</li>
      <li><strong>Diaspora–Integration Pragmatism:</strong> Lobbying, narrative work, culture. Slow power: the kind that changes syllabi and newsrooms.</li>
      <li><strong>Gulf–Normalization Pragmatism:</strong> Recognize facts, harvest partnerships, send aid. Commerce as sedative.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Global currents</strong></p>
    <ol start="7">
      <li><strong>U.S. Strategic Pragmatism:</strong> Security guarantees, force multipliers, vetoes, and “process.”</li>
      <li><strong>European Conditional Pragmatism:</strong> Recognition with footnotes; law on paper, exemptions in practice.</li>
      <li><strong>Russian/Chinese Pragmatism:</strong> Multipolar leverage; Palestine as instrument in a larger orchestra.</li>
      <li><strong>Islamic-World Pragmatism:</strong> A split current—confrontational leverage for some; transactional calm for others.</li>
      <li><strong>Global South Pragmatism:</strong> Lawfare, UN votes, anti-colonial memory. Justice pursued by procedure.</li>
      <li><strong>Humanitarian Pragmatism:</strong> Keep the NICU powered tonight; argue politics tomorrow.</li>
      <li><strong>Jewish–Israeli Pragmatism:</strong> Fractured between security-first, annexation as “clarity,” and a shrinking peace camp that remembers Oslo as a verb.</li>
      <li><strong>Western Progressive Pragmatism:</strong> Pressure without rupture; conditional aid and careful words.</li>
      <li><strong>Grassroots/Activist Pragmatism:</strong> Boycott, divestment, litigation. Nonviolence as instrument, not slogan.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>These currents overlap, collide, and trade vocabulary. A technocrat might quote scripture about peace; a resister might cite international law; a European statement may borrow the cadence of justice while keeping its budget in stability. The triangle holds them all.</p>

  <section id="test">
    <h2>III. The Knife or the Mirage: A Test</h2>
    <p>Words are cheap in our century. So let us grade pragmatism not by tone but by outcomes. Here is a five-point test—insufficient, but better than the weather:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Rights Delivered:</strong> Which rights go from paper to life—movement, safety, due process, property, political voice; even under the shadow of checkpoints and drones?</li>
      <li><strong>Harm Reduced:</strong> Not theoretically, not “on average,” but measurably—fewer demolitions, fewer funerals, fewer amputations, fewer ruins.</li>
      <li><strong>Reversibility:</strong> Are gains protected from tomorrow’s minister or midnight raid? Can a corridor be closed by a speech, or a right be rescinded by one siren?</li>
      <li><strong>Agency Restored:</strong> Does the policy produce citizens, or clients at the mercy of soldiers and clerks? Subjects, or suitors?</li>
      <li><strong>Narrative Integrity:</strong> Does it tell the truth about occupation as an architecture of control? Euphemism is also a weapon.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Apply this test to any claimed “pragmatism.” Does it cut the machinery of dispossession—or does it shimmer, leaving the bulldozers intact?</p>
  </section>

  <section id="axioms">
    <h2>IV. Axioms for an Honest Conversation</h2>
    <p>If we are to avoid the swamp of euphemism, the discussion needs floorboards—axioms upon which disagreement is noble rather than nihilistic.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Axiom 1: Asymmetry is structural.</strong> One side commands an army, an air force, drones, prisons, checkpoints, demolitions, and sieges—with impunity guaranteed by vetoes. The other holds funerals, petitions, and fragments of deterrence. Any “balanced” language that erases this imbalance is itself a form of violence.</li>
      <li><strong>Axiom 2: Civilian immunity is non-negotiable.</strong> There are no “human animals.” There are infants with names, families with histories, and elders with graves. To obscure this with categories is to prepare the ground for atrocity.</li>
      <li><strong>Axiom 3: Occupation corrodes law and soul.</strong> It mutates the occupier’s law into a machinery of exceptions, and the occupied’s law into an absence. What survives is not order but arbitrary command.</li>
      <li><strong>Axiom 4: Resistance is not a sacrament.</strong> It is a strategy—born of dispossession and measured by its ethics and its fruits. To sanctify it blindly is to excuse ruin; to deny it categorically is to demand submission to perpetual usurpation.</li>
      <li><strong>Axiom 5: Humanitarianism is not a constitution.</strong> It can keep the NICU lit for a night, but it cannot guarantee a tomorrow. To confuse aid with justice is to turn survival into a narcotic.</li>
      <li><strong>Axiom 6: Peace without law becomes peace by fear.</strong> And fear, like gasoline, burns quickly and consumes those who store it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These axioms do not settle maps, capitals, or flags. They settle the terms of how we talk—so words stop murdering the truth before the truth can save a life.</p>
