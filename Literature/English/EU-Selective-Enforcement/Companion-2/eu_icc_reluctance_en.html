<h1>Selective Enforcement: When the EU Activates Its Human Rights Clauses — and When It Doesn’t</h1>

<h2>A Court for Some: The EU’s Reluctance Toward ICC Investigations Involving Israel</h2>

<p>The European Union prides itself on being a leading defender of international law. Its officials often speak of a “rules-based international order” and uphold the <strong>International Criminal Court (ICC)</strong> as a cornerstone of global justice. EU foreign policy documents affirm support for the Court’s mandate, and EU member states contribute significantly to its budget and institutional standing.</p>

<p>Yet when the ICC turns its attention to <strong>Israel</strong>, many of these same champions of justice grow noticeably quiet — or openly obstructionist.</p>

<h3>A Pattern of Reluctance</h3>

<p>In 2021, the ICC announced the opening of a formal investigation into alleged war crimes committed in the occupied Palestinian territories — by both Israeli and Palestinian actors. The move, though grounded in legal precedent and investigative findings, was met with <strong>uneven and often hostile reactions</strong> from within the EU.</p>

<p>Several EU member states — <strong>Germany, Austria, Hungary, Czechia, Poland, the Netherlands</strong>, and others — swiftly <strong>distanced themselves</strong> from the ICC investigation:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Germany</strong>, while affirming its general support for the Court, issued a public statement asserting that the ICC <em>“has no jurisdiction”</em> to investigate alleged war crimes in Palestinian territories, arguing that <em>Palestine is not a state</em> under international law. This position not only aligned with Israeli objections but also contradicted the UN General Assembly’s recognition of Palestine as a non-member observer state and the ICC's own Pre-Trial Chamber ruling.</li>
    <li><strong>Austria</strong> echoed Berlin’s stance, emphasizing its opposition to what it described as a <em>“politicization”</em> of international justice. Austrian officials expressed concern that the investigation would harm the peace process — a position that effectively <strong>equates accountability with instability</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Hungary</strong> went further, framing the ICC investigation as a <em>“dangerous precedent”</em>, undermining the integrity of international institutions. Its Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the probe threatened to delegitimize Israel and misuse legal instruments for political purposes.</li>
    <li><strong>Czechia</strong> also joined the dissenting camp, submitting an <em>amicus curiae</em> brief to the ICC opposing the Court’s jurisdiction. It argued that only states recognized under international law can delegate jurisdiction to the ICC — implicitly denying Palestine's right to seek justice.</li>
    <li><strong>Poland and the Netherlands</strong>, while less vocal, aligned themselves with a more cautious and non-committal approach, expressing <em>“concerns about the timing and scope”</em> of the investigation, and quietly supporting efforts within the EU to avoid public division.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, the <strong>European External Action Service (EEAS)</strong>, the EU’s diplomatic arm, issued a carefully worded statement that <em>refrained from endorsing the ICC investigation</em>. It emphasized the need for a two-state solution and cautioned against “unilateral steps,” implying that legal accountability could be construed as a political obstacle — a framing that <strong>displaces law in favor of diplomacy</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This posture stands in stark contrast to the EU’s support for ICC proceedings elsewhere — whether in Ukraine, Sudan, or Myanmar — where the Court’s jurisdiction has been affirmed and applauded, even in the absence of clear state party consensus.</p>
<p>In sum, while not all EU states opposed the ICC outright, <strong>a coordinated pattern of resistance or cautious disengagement</strong> emerged — not in defense of international law, but in protection of a state accused of violating it.</p>

<h3>Double Standards in Practice</h3>

<p>What emerges is a troubling inconsistency: <em>International law is upheld when it confronts the enemies of Europe’s geopolitical order</em>, but <em>marginalized when it implicates allies</em>. The ICC’s credibility is thus not undermined by the Global South — as often alleged — but by those who claim to be its most fervent supporters.</p>

<p>The EU has often criticized non-cooperation with the ICC from countries like the United States, Russia, or China. But its <strong>internal divisions and political caution</strong> regarding Israel mirror those very same evasions.</p>

<h3>Legalism or Political Expediency?</h3>

<p>While some EU states may frame their opposition in technical legal terms — disputing jurisdiction or procedural grounds — the pattern reveals a broader political discomfort with <strong>holding Israel legally accountable</strong>, even when the evidence demands it. In effect, <strong>the ICC is treated as a flexible instrument</strong>, its universality sacrificed at the altar of diplomatic priorities.</p>

<h3>The Ethical Question</h3>

<p>Can a court be truly international — and credible — if powerful states selectively defend or deny its reach?</p>
<p>And can the EU still claim moral leadership if it supports accountability for all, except those it considers too close to offend?</p>
