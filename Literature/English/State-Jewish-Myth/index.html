      <h1>Must There Be a “Jewish State”?<br><small>Law, Humanity, and Common Sense against the Myth of Exceptionality</small></h1>
      <p><em>By Qais Aljoan</em></p>
    </header>

    <section id="intro">
      <h2>I. Netanyahu’s Line</h2>
      <p>In his escalation against Spain, Benjamin Netanyahu claims that criticism of Israel “threatens the only Jewish state in the world.” The line folds three assumptions into one: (1) that a “Jewish state” must exist; (2) that it must be in Palestine; and (3) that ancient claims legitimize modern dispossession. Each fails under law, humanity, and common sense.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="state-necessity">
      <h2>II. Must a “Jewish State” Exist?</h2>
      <p><strong>Law.</strong> International law recognizes the right of peoples to self-determination, not a right to a confessional state. The <em>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</em> and the <em>ICCPR</em> bind states to equality without religious discrimination. Any state that encodes religious supremacy risks structural discrimination against non-adherents.</p>
      <p><strong>Humanity.</strong> Jewish people—like any people—are entitled to security, memory, language, and culture. None of that requires a religion-exclusive state; it can be realized within plural, equal-citizenship democracies.</p>
      <p><strong>Common sense.</strong> If every religion required its own exclusivist state, the world would fragment into sectarian micro-states. Coexistence would collapse.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="location">
      <h2>III. Must It Be in Palestine?</h2>
      <p><strong>Law.</strong> UNGA Resolution 181 (1947) proposed a provisional partition; it was never a blank cheque for colonization or expulsion. The 1967 occupation, settlement enterprise, and Gaza siege violate the <em>Fourth Geneva Convention</em> and peremptory rules of humanitarian law.</p>
      <p><strong>Humanity.</strong> Jewish communities flourished historically in Baghdad, Fez, Córdoba, Warsaw, New York, and beyond. Making Palestine “the only option” was a political-colonial choice, not a moral necessity.</p>
      <p><strong>Common sense.</strong> If the Shoah was Europe’s crime against Jews, justice could not be to dispossess Palestinians who bore no responsibility. If a house burns in Berlin, redress is not to evict a family in Jaffa.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="ancient-claims">
      <h2>IV. Do Ancient Claims Legitimize Modern Occupation?</h2>
      <p><strong>Law.</strong> Modern international law does not award sovereignty on the basis of millennial narratives. The operative principle is <em>uti possidetis juris</em> and contemporary self-determination—not the cartography of empires long gone.</p>
      <p><strong>Humanity.</strong> Sacred texts are spiritual heritage, not property deeds. Turning scripture into real-estate licenses injures both faith and justice.</p>
      <p><strong>Common sense.</strong> If remote ancestry conferred title, Rome could reclaim London, empires could rewind borders, and entire continents would be uprooted. Justice must address who lives there now, who was recently expelled, and who suffers occupation today.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>V. Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Jewish people, like all people, deserve security and dignity. That does not translate into a right to a confessional state in Palestine—least of all at the expense of another people’s home, bread, and freedom. Security needs law, not supremacy; memory is a universal warning, not a private license.</p>
